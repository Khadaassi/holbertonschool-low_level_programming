# Holberton School Low-Level Programming - Hello World

This repository contains introductory C programming projects focusing on printing text and basic concepts.

## General

### Overview
In this project, I delved into the fundamentals of C programming, understanding why it's considered a powerful language and the contributions of its creators. I learned about the compilation process using `gcc`, the role of an entry point (`main` function), and how to print text using various functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`. Additionally, I grasped essential concepts like obtaining the size of data types, adhering to coding style conventions, and identifying necessary headers for standard library functions. Understanding these concepts lays a strong foundation for further exploration in C programming.

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, I was able to:

- Appreciate the significance of C programming and its strengths.
- Recognize the key figures in C's development, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
- Understand the compilation process with `gcc` and the role of an entry point.
- Master the usage of `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar` for text output.
- Utilize the unary operator `sizeof` to determine the size of data types.
- Compile C code with `gcc` and adhere to the official C coding style.
- Identify the appropriate headers for standard library functions.
- Comprehend the influence of the `main` function on a program's return value.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a newline.
- There should be no errors or warnings during compilation.
- Code should use the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.

## Repository Structure
- This repository follows Holberton School's project requirements for low-level programming.
- Each project directory contains C files focusing on specific learning objectives.
- The repository includes a README.md file providing an overview of the project.

## Project Structure
- **hello_world.c**: A basic C program printing "Hello, World!" using `printf`.
- **5-printf.c**: Demonstrates usage of `printf` for text printing.
- **4-puts.c**: Shows how to print text using `puts`.
- **6-size.c**: Illustrates printing characters using `putchar`.
