# Variable, If, Else, While

During this project, I gained a solid understanding of fundamental concepts in C programming, particularly focusing on variables, conditional statements (if, else), loops (while), and basic operators.

## Learning Objectives

### General
Throughout the project, I learned:
- How to effectively utilize arithmetic, logical, and relational operators in C to perform various operations.
- Recognizing the concept of TRUE and FALSE values in C, crucial for implementing conditional statements and boolean operations.
- Application of boolean operators to evaluate expressions and make decisions within the code.
- Utilizing if and if...else statements for conditional execution, allowing the program to branch based on certain conditions.
- The importance of commenting code for clarity and documentation purposes, aiding in understanding code logic and functionality.
- Declaration and initialization of variables of different types, such as char, int, and unsigned int, and assigning values to them.
- Printing variable values using printf, a vital function for debugging and displaying program output.
- The iterative nature of the while loop and its usage to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met.
- How to effectively work with variables within the context of a while loop to control the loop's behavior.
- Understanding the ASCII character set and its significance in representing characters in C programming.
- Purpose and application of gcc flags -m32 and -m64, which specify the target architecture for compilation.

## Requirements
To meet the project requirements, I ensured that:
- I used allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs) for code development.
- All code files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options (-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89).
- Each file ended with a new line to adhere to coding standards.
- There were no compilation errors or warnings during the build process.
- I followed the Betty style for writing code, verified using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

## Project Structure
The project directory contained several C files, each focusing on different aspects of variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops.
- Each file demonstrated specific concepts, such as variable declaration, conditional execution, and iterative looping.
- `0-positive_or_negative.c`:print if the numbere is positive, zero or negative.
- `1-last_digit.c`:prints the last digit of ther number stored in the variable.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`:prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`:prints the alphabet in lowercase and in upper case.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`:prints the alphabet in lowercase except q and e.
- `5-print_numbers.c`:prints all single digit numbers of base 10.
- `6-print_numberz.c`:prints all single digit numbers of base 10.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: prints alphabet in reverse.
- `8-print_base16.`:prints all the numbers of base 16.
- `9-print_comb.c`:print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- The README.md file provided an overview of the project objectives, requirements, and usage instructions.
